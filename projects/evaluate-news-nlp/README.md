# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

## Project Description

This Udacity-directed project utilizes an NLP SDK (software development kit) from [Aylien API](https://docs.aylien.com/) to process the general sentiment of the submitted sentence. 

The API response contains a number of useful properties that not only describe the certainty of the sentence but also the following:
- Polarity
- Subjectivity
- Text 
- Polarity confidence
- Subjectivity confidence

Although this API is typically used by developers, it has client-based applications. It is my hope that users will find a fun and useful tool in this application that demonstrates how far machine learning has come.

## Project Setup

1. Fork then clone this project, using the master branch
2. Point your terminal at the root directory on your local disk in which you cloned the project
3. Spin up your [**node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) server with the CLI command "npm run start"
4. Spin up your webpack development server with the command "[**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) run dev"; this should open your default browser and run the application

## Project Use

Now, all you have to do is copy and paste a sentence for sentiment analysis into the field. Feel free to create your own sentence as well. Once you submit it, you should see an analysis of the sentence populate the bottom of the screen under the **Sentiment Results** heading.
